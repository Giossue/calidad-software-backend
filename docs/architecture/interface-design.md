# Interface Design For Operational Applications

## Goal

Reduce cognitive and visual workload while keeping frequent actions fast. A screen is
successful when the user can identify where they are, understand current state, and
perform the primary task without reading implementation commentary.

## Start From The User Task

Before building, answer:

1. Who uses this screen and how often?
2. What decision or action is primary?
3. What information is required before that action?
4. What belongs in detail, history, or an advanced view?
5. Which fields can the backend derive?

If these answers are missing, do not compensate with more cards, text, or controls.

## Choose The Primary Surface

| User need                                          | Preferred surface              |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Scan, compare, filter, and act on records          | Table-first module             |
| Create or edit a short independent record          | Modal dialog                   |
| Complete a long, high-risk, multi-section workflow | Full page                      |
| Inspect one record without losing list context     | Detail modal or drawer         |
| Adjust a small local value                         | Inline control when reversible |
| Switch lenses or filters over one collection       | Internal view selector         |
| Reach a section with its own records and actions   | Sidebar submodule              |
| Monitor a few decision-driving metrics             | Compact dashboard              |

Do not put a full CRUD form permanently next to its table. Do not use a modal for a
workflow that needs extensive context, several sections, or comparison while editing.

Do not use tabs to separate the pages of a module. A section with its own records,
actions, or permission is a destination and belongs in the sidebar, not behind a tab. See
`navigation-responsive.md`.

## Module Composition

A standard list module should usually contain:

1. Page breadcrumb or context label and one page title.
2. One compact module header with icon, concise description, and primary actions when needed.
3. One table surface containing search, filters, columns, rows, and pagination.
4. Focused dialogs for create, edit, detail, assignment, import, or advanced filtering.

Remove the module header when the page title and table title already communicate the
same thing. Never repeat the same title and description in consecutive containers.

A module is complete when everything it offers works end to end against the real backend:
list, create, edit, detail, and the removal or deactivation the domain allows. A list that
renders while its create dialog fails is an unfinished module.

## Information Hierarchy

- Use one clear page title; reserve large typography for true page-level hierarchy.
- Keep panel headings compact and aligned with their density.
- Put primary actions at the top-right of the surface they affect.
- Keep filters physically attached to the data they filter.
- Put row-specific detail and commands in row actions.
- Use helper text only when it prevents a realistic error.
- Use labels, not placeholder-only inputs.
- Prefer domain language over technical abbreviations.

## Visual Fatigue Guardrails

- Do not wrap every section in a floating card.
- Do not nest cards inside cards.
- Do not add KPI cards above every table; add a metric only when it changes a decision.
- Do not add large empty panels to balance a layout.
- Do not render permanent success, loading, or informational banners after routine actions.
- Do not repeat descriptions already clear from the label or selected navigation item.
- Do not put secondary detail beside a table when it can open from the selected row.
- Do not expose every advanced option by default; use progressive disclosure.
- Avoid decorative gradients, oversized radii, and ornamental backgrounds in work surfaces.

Whitespace should clarify groups, not make an operational screen sparse and scroll-heavy.

## Generated Defaults To Avoid

Generated interfaces converge on the same recognizable choices. They are not neutral, and
they make every product look alike. The guardrails above already cover gradients, oversized
radii, and ornamental backgrounds; these are the rest:

| Default                                | Why it fails                                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A violet or indigo palette by habit    | Signals a template rather than this product's palette               |
| Uniform maximum corner rounding        | Erases the radius hierarchy that real systems use to group elements |
| A generic hero section                 | Layout chosen before content, unrelated to the user's task          |
| Placeholder prose instead of real copy | Hides wrapping, length, and overflow problems until production      |
| Uniform card grids for everything      | Ignores information priority and how the user scans                 |
| Layered shadows for depth              | Competes with content and costs rendering on low-end devices        |
| Generous equal padding everywhere      | Destroys hierarchy and wastes the screen on operational work        |

Use the project's real palette, spacing scale, radius set, and content. Never invent a
spacing or radius value that is not on the scale.

## Cards, Bands, And Containers

Use cards for repeated entities, bounded tools, dialogs, and genuinely independent
objects. Use unframed sections or full-width bands for page structure. Keep radius at
8px or less unless the established design system says otherwise.

## Commands And Controls

- Use icon buttons for familiar compact commands such as edit, delete, refresh, close, download, and visibility.
- Give every icon-only command an accessible name and opaque tooltip.
- Use text or icon-plus-text for primary commands whose meaning is not universal.
- Use switches or checkboxes for binary settings, segmented controls for modes, selects for bounded options, and steppers for integer quantities.
- Keep primary actions solid and visually consistent across modules.
- Destructive actions require clear wording, confirmation proportional to risk, and lifecycle-safe backend behavior.

## Dashboards

Dashboards summarize decisions; they are not a substitute for modules.

- Keep KPI count small and attach context such as period, trend, or comparison.
- Use charts only when shape, composition, or change is easier to understand visually.
- Keep operational tables after summaries when users need to inspect the underlying records.
- Do not duplicate the same aggregate in a KPI, chart, and summary list.
- Empty dashboards should explain setup or next action, not fabricate demo data.

## Business Language

Show what the user recognizes:

- a person or organization name instead of an internal identifier;
- a searchable record label instead of a foreign-key input;
- a status label instead of an enum token;
- a masked secret state instead of a credential reference;
- a generated human reference when a record needs one.

### Voice

Write for someone who must understand the screen the first time they read it:

- address the user directly; do not narrate the system in the third person;
- name the action and the object, not the mechanism that performs it;
- do not explain business rules, internal processes, or third-party services in the interface;
- do not quote requirement documents, ticket numbers, or specification sections in visible copy;
- keep that traceability in code comments or documentation, never on the product surface;
- delete any sentence the user does not need in order to decide or act.

Technical detail belongs in permission-gated audit or diagnostic views.

## Final Simplification Pass

Before declaring the screen complete, remove one unnecessary layer:

- a duplicated heading;
- a summary that does not affect a decision;
- a card border around a page section;
- helper text that restates the label;
- a visible technical field the backend can derive;
- a control that can move into a row action or advanced dialog.

Then verify that the primary action and current state remain obvious.
