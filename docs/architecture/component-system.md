# Shared Frontend Component Contracts

## Purpose

The exact component names may follow the codebase, but each application should provide
one shared implementation for recurring operational interactions. Do not create a new
variant in each module.

## Foundation

Prefer the Radix-based primitives already installed in `resources/js/components/ui`,
styled through semantic Tailwind tokens. Use Lucide icons instead of hand-drawn SVGs
when a suitable icon exists. Treat third-party component registries as source code to
review and adapt, not as an independent design system.

Atomic design is a composition rule, not a required folder taxonomy. Keep primitives
small and domain-free; compose them into shared patterns, module blocks, and finally
Inertia pages. Do not create wrapper components that only rename one primitive.

## Recommended Inventory

| Example contract        | Responsibility                                                             |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AppDataTable<T>`       | Search, filters, sorting, columns, rows, selection, states, and pagination |
| `TableToolbar`          | Stable arrangement of search, filters, columns, and table commands         |
| `TablePagination`       | One footer for client and server pagination                                |
| `ColumnVisibilityMenu`  | Business-facing optional column selection                                  |
| `RowActionButton`       | Icon action with permission/state handling and opaque tooltip              |
| `FormDialog`            | Accessible create/edit modal with stable header, body, and footer          |
| `EntityPickerDialog<T>` | Searchable, filterable, paginated relationship selection                   |
| `ConfirmDialog`         | Risk-proportional confirmation, with typed name when irreversible          |
| `DatePickerField`       | Localized, theme-aware date selection with clear behavior                  |
| `DateTimePickerField`   | Date/time selection with explicit commit when required                     |
| `PasswordField`         | Masked sensitive input with accessible visibility toggle                   |
| `FileField`             | Upload, replace, rename, and remove managed files with per-file state      |
| `IntegerStepperField`   | Bounded whole-number input with increment/decrement controls               |
| `AsyncButton`           | Stable loading and duplicate-submit prevention                             |
| `MutationFeedback`      | Shared Inertia pending, success, error, and reset behavior                 |
| `SemanticToaster`       | Shared success, error, warning, information, and loading feedback          |
| `StatusBadge`           | Shared state label using icon or dot plus color, consistent across modules |
| `EmptyState`            | Distinguish no data, no matches, missing prerequisite, and no permission   |
| `ErrorState`            | Sanitized error with safe retry                                            |
| `PageSkeleton`          | Geometry-preserving initial loading                                        |
| `AppSidebar`            | Permission-aware navigation with no more than two levels                   |
| `AppHeader`             | Page context, mobile menu, theme, and account actions                      |
| `PermissionGate`        | Presentation guard only; backend remains authoritative                     |

Names in this table are illustrative. Reuse an equivalent existing component rather than
renaming a mature codebase only to match this document.

## Contract Rules

Shared components own interaction consistency, not business policy.

- `AppDataTable` owns table mechanics; the module supplies typed columns, Laravel
  paginator data, filter options, and valid actions.
- `FormDialog` owns focus, dismissal, responsive geometry, and footer placement; the form owns fields and business validation.
- `EntityPickerDialog` returns selected business records; it does not know a specific entity type.
- `SemanticToaster` owns visual variants; callers provide human-readable messages.
- `ConfirmDialog` owns the confirmation ladder; the caller supplies the record label and the consequence.
- `StatusBadge` owns the visual encoding of a state; the module maps its domain values onto it.
- `PermissionGate` may hide or disable controls, but cannot replace API authorization.
- Date and number components own parsing/display boundaries and return canonical values.

Do not put Inertia visits, database-shaped DTOs, domain-specific permissions, or record
lifecycle rules inside a generic visual primitive.

## Extension Threshold

Add an option to a shared component when:

- at least two modules need the behavior;
- the behavior has the same interaction and accessibility contract;
- the option does not make the base component understand domain entities.

Create a module-specific composition when the workflow has unique business sequencing,
calculations, or lifecycle rules. Compose shared primitives inside it.

## External Component Intake

Before adopting a component from a registry or community catalog:

1. Inspect the installed source and dependency additions.
2. Remove demo data, branding, global styles, and unrelated variants.
3. Replace hardcoded colors, radius, shadows, fonts, and spacing with project tokens.
4. Replace custom SVGs with the established icon library where appropriate.
5. Align props and states with the shared application contract.
6. Verify keyboard, focus, screen-reader labels, reduced motion, light/dark, and mobile.
7. Consolidate or remove any existing duplicate component.

Do not keep two table systems, two toaster systems, or multiple pagination patterns after
adopting a replacement.

## Stable Geometry

Shared controls must define stable dimensions so icons, loading text, validation, hover,
or dynamic labels do not shift neighboring content. Use consistent medium icon sizes and
at least 44px touch targets for header, navigation, dialog close, and other standalone
touch actions.

## Ownership And Documentation

Document meaningful contract changes in `frontend.md` or an ADR. When replacing a shared
primitive, migrate its consumers in one planned sequence and remove the obsolete variant.
