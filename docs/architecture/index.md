## Architecture Rules

- Document boundaries explicitly.
- Keep dependency direction enforceable.
- Prefer tests or lint rules for critical constraints.
- Record irreversible or costly decisions as ADRs.
- Use the default stack unless an ADR explains why a project deviates.
- Prefer Laravel conventions and the installed stack over speculative layers or dependencies.
